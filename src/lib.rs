//! `evtclib` is a crate aiming to provide utility functions to parse and work
//! with `.evtc` reports generated by arcdps.
//!
//! # About evtc Files
//!
//! evtc files are files generated by the (inofficial) arcdps addon to Guild Wars 2. They contain
//! metadata about a fight in the game, such as the boss's name (if it was a raid or fractal boss),
//! the participants, and a stripped-down log of the complete fight.
//!
//! There are other programs (such as
//! [GW2-Elite-Insights-Parser](https://github.com/baaron4/GW2-Elite-Insights-Parser/)) and
//! websites (such as [dps.report](https://dps.report)) which allow you to generate reports from
//! evtc files.
//!
//! A common way to store and distribute evtc files is to zip them to either a `.evtc.zip` (old
//! way) or a `.zevtc` (new way). evtclib uses [`zip`](https://crates.io/crates/zip) to read them,
//! prodiving the [`raw::parse_zip`][raw::parse_zip] convenience function.
//!
//! # Crate Structure
//!
//! The crate consists of two main parts: The [`raw`][raw] parser, which is used to read structured
//! data from binary input streams, and the higher-level abstrations provided in the root and
//! [`event`][event] submodules.
//!
//! Additionally, there are some defintions (such as IDs for various game items) in the
//! [`gamedata`][gamedata] module.
//!
//! The main structs that you should be dealing with are the [`Log`][Log] and its components, such
//! as [`Event`][Event] and [`Agent`][Agent].
//!
//! # Workflow
//!
//! Currently, there is no convenience function to turn a file into a [`Log`][Log] directly, so you
//! have to use the [`raw`][raw] submodule to obtain a low-level [`Evtc`][raw::Evtc], and then
//! convert it to the high-level [`Log`][Log].
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use std::fs::File;
//! // Open a file for processing
//! let mut file = File::open("my_log.evtc")?;
//! // Parse the raw content of the file
//! let raw_log = evtclib::raw::parse_file(&mut file)?;
//! // Process the file to do the nitty-gritty low-level stuff done
//! let log = evtclib::process(&raw_log)?;
//! // Do work on the log
//! for player in log.players() {
//!     println!("Player {} participated!", player.account_name());
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Make sure to take a look at the note on "Buffering" in the [parser
//! module](raw/parser/index.html#buffering) in order to increase the speed of your application.
//!
//! # Writing evtc Files
//!
//! Currently, `evtclib` does not provide a way to output or modify evtc files. This is for two
//! reasons:
//!
//! * The only sensible source for logs is the arcdps addon itself, most applications only consume
//! them.
//! * The library was needed for reading support, and writing support has never been a priority.
//!
//! While there are legitimate use cases for writing/modification support, they are currently not
//! implemented (but might be in a future version).

/// An agent.
///
/// Agents in arcdps are very versatile, as a lot of things end up being an "agent". This includes:
/// * Players
/// * Bosses
/// * Any additional mobs that spawn
/// * Mesmer illusions
/// * Ranger spirits, pets
/// * Guardian spirit weapons
/// * ...
///
/// Generally, you can divide them into three kinds ([`AgentKind`][AgentKind]):
/// * [`Player`][Player]: All players themselves.
/// * [`Character`][Character]: Non-player mobs, including most bosses, "adds" and player-generated
///   characters.
/// * [`Gadget`][Gadget]: Some additional gadgets, such as ley rifts, continuum split, ...
///
/// All of these agents share some common fields, which are the ones accessible in `Agent<Kind>`.
/// The kind can be retrieved using [`.kind()`][Agent::kind], which can be matched on.
///
/// # Obtaining an agent
///
/// The normal way to obtain the agents is to use the [`.agents()`](Log::agents) method on a
/// [`Log`][Log], or one of the other accessor methods (like [`.players()`][Log::players] or
/// [`.agent_by_addr()`][Log::agent_by_addr]).
///
/// In the cases where you already have a [`raw::Agent`][raw::Agent] available, you can also
/// convert it to an [`Agent`][Agent] by using the standard
/// [`TryFrom`][TryFrom]/[`TryInto`][std::convert::TryInto] traits:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use evtclib::{Agent, raw};
/// use std::convert::TryInto;
/// let raw_agent: raw::Agent = panic!();
/// let agent: Agent = raw_agent.try_into().unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// Note that you can convert references as well, so if you plan on re-using the raw agent
/// afterwards, you should opt for `Agent::try_from(&raw_agent)` instead.
///
/// # The `Kind` parameter
///
/// The type parameter is not actually used and only exists at the type level. It can be used to
/// tag `Agent`s containing a known kind. For example, `Agent<Player>` implements
/// [`.player()`][Agent::player], which returns a `&Player` directly (instead of a
/// `Option<&Player>`). This works because such tagged `Agent`s can only be constructed (safely)
/// using [`.as_player()`][Agent::as_player], [`.as_gadget()`][Agent::as_gadget] or
/// [`.as_character()`][Agent::as_character]. This is useful since functions like
/// [`Log::players`][Log::players], which already filter only players, don't require the consumer
/// to do another check/pattern match for the right agent kind.
///
/// The unit type `()` is used to tag `Agent`s which contain an undetermined type, and it is the
/// default if you write `Agent` without any parameters.
///
/// The downside is that methods which work on `Agent`s theoretically should be generic over
/// `Kind`. An escape hatch is the method [`.erase()`][Agent::erase], which erases the kind
/// information and produces the default `Agent<()>`. Functions/methods that only take `Agent<()>`
/// can therefore be used by any other agent as well.

        //
        // Why is this safe?

        // case it can lead to an unexpected panic, but the "guarantee" made by T is rather weak in
        // that regard.
        //
        // What are the alternatives?
        // None, as far as I'm aware. Going from Agent<U> to Agent<T> is possible in safe Rust by
        // destructuring the struct, or alternatively by [2] (if it would be implemented). However,
