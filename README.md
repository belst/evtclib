evtclib
#######

`evtclib` is a Rust library that allows you to parse `.evtc` files, as
generated by the [arcdps addon](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) for the
Guild Wars 2 video game.

It supports a low-level parsing interface and a higher-level interface which
interprets some of the data and converts it to a more appropriate interface.

`evtclib` uses `cargo` as its build tool and as such can be included as a
dependency in other Rust projects. API docs can be generated locally by running
`cargo doc`.
